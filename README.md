# Blinking_LED_and_look_up_table
On a Raspberry Pi running Linux, I employed the nano command to execute a straightforward C program. This program, crucially enhanced by a lookup table, facilitates seamless interaction between hardware and software. By inputting a regular number, the program triggers the LED to blink, with the lookup table efficiently determining the count of '1' bits in the binary representation. This approach not only optimizes performance but also underscores the significance of employing a lookup table for efficient computation.
